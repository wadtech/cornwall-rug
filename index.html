  <dt><h3>Do you only talk about Ruby?</h3></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Ruby usually goes hand-in-hand with other technologies or as part of a wider ecosystem in tools and applications. As a result we often talk about other technologies and their uses.</p>
    <p>Also, being a social group there are plenty of other things to talk about!</p>
